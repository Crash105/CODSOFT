# Java Developer Internship at CODSOFT  

This repository contains the projects I developed during my 4-week Java Developer Internship at CODSOFT, where I created 5 Java applications.  

## Applications Developed  
### 1. Number Guesser Game  
A simple game where users guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.  

### 2. Student Grade Calculator  
Calculates and displays total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade based on user input.  

### 3. ATM Interface  
Simulates an ATM, allowing users to modify their account balance through withdrawals and deposits.  

### 4. Currency Converter GUI  
- Designed a Java Swing-based GUI for real-time currency conversion across 35 international currencies.  
- Used the exchangeRatesAPI.io API for accurate exchange rates.  
- Adapted open-source code that originally used the console for API interaction.  

### 5. Student Management Application  
- Built a Java Swing-based application for managing student records.  
- Utilized HashMap algorithms to optimize student lookups and record handling.  

## Reflections and Future Plans  
One of the highlights of this internship was stepping outside my comfort zone to learn new tools like JavaFX and focusing on optimizing algorithms for better performance.  

Looking ahead, I plan to integrate database functionality into the Student Management Application, transforming it into a full-fledged CRUD application.  

## Acknowledgments  
I would like to extend my gratitude to CODSOFT for this incredible learning experience.
